This vegan dish having its origin from the Hakka cuisine is fairly easy to put together and can be made as a side dish, starters or even as finger food. The Indo Chinese cooking has originated from the Chinese settlers in Kolkata, generations ago. The modern Indo Chinese cooking vastly differs from the food found in China. Of late there is not a single city in India that does not have a few Chinese restaurants!  The only way to describe the Baked chili potato is mouth-watering. How to make the baked chili potato so that it is a favorite of both the young and old? The answer lies in the sauce that coats the potato wedges. The Baked chili potato wedges are dunked in a spicy, sour and mildly sweet sauce to tickle the palate and make you crave for more. They are then baked in the oven to get a crispy coat and for an extra layer of crunch, the Baked chili potato wedges are tossed in toasted sesame seeds and slivers of green spring onions to bring out another level of deliciousness. The Baked chili potato video is a foolproof plan to make this scrumptious dish. Baked chili potato description would be, crispy on the exterior and soft in the inside, with some nutty flavor from the sesame seeds and a zing of freshness from the chopped green spring onions. Baked chili potato calories are drastically reduced with the elimination of sugar which is substituted by the tomatoes to give mild sweetness to the dish and bake the potato wedges instead of deep-frying. This definitely lowers the calories making it a lot healthier.</p></div>

    			<h1>Make this dish better</h1>
    			<p style="font-size: 22px;">Serve the baked chili potato immediately after it's cooked to keep the potatoes moist and crispy. Potatoes can be air-fried for a healthier option. You can use baby potatoes along with the skin, sliced in half. You need to cut the potato wedges to one size to ensure that they cook evenly. For extra crisp baked chili potato wedges, dunk the potato chunks into boiling water for a few minutes to remove the starch. Thus stopping them from going soggy while baking. Served as a side along with Hakka noodles of fried rice or as a snack be prepared to see the food vanish from the plate! So, what are you waiting for -start cooking!</p>
