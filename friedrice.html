    		<div class="col-sm-6"><p style="font-size: 22px;">Healthy fried rice is a guilt-free version of the widely popular Indo-Chinese fried rice. Fried rice is a hot favorite for Indians and is vastly different from the fried rice found across South East Asia. The Indian version uses long grain and non-sticky rice, whereas the rest of the Asian countries use glutinous opaque rice grains that are sticky when cooked. Fried rice and the rest of the Indo-Chinese cuisine were introduced by Hakka Chinese settlers who came to Kolkata, India, in the early 19th century. Over some time, the food has adapted to the fiery taste of the Indian pallet.  Healthy fried rice, restaurant-style, is made with a lot of crunchy vegetables and rice, making this a wholesome dish. Healthy fried rice goes with Indo-Chinese side dishes like cauliflower Manchurian, Chilli tofu, sweet and sour vegetables, and chili baby corn. They can be equally partnered with the Indian curries like paneer butter masala, maa ki dal, or palak curries. The healthy fried rice caloric, counts up to 468 and is a filling meal by itself or can be had with a stir-fried leafy salad for a healthy diet option. The healthy fried rice needs about 10 minutes of actual cooking time after the food prep. The combination of the vinegar's sharpness and the saltiness from the soy sauce brings a zing to the dish.

    			<h1>Health Benefits of Fried Rice</h1>
    			<p style="font-size: 22px;">The two elements that you need to keep in mind for a successful healthy fried rice at home are that the rice grains remain separate and that the vegetables are crunchy and do not lose their shape. The cooked rice you need to be cooled rapidly. Firstly, rice needs to be soaked in water for at least 30 minutes before it's cooked, once cooked you need to ensure that the rice is dry. Drain the water completely, then spread the rice over a baking sheet or on a tray thinly, to cool down. The vegetables need to be stir-fried in a wok on a high flame to retain their color and crunchiness. A couple of tips for you, slice the vegetables really fine so that they cook fast in the wok, and add some hot chili sauce for that extra heat. A word of advice - Get your food prep done, rice cooked and cooled, and the wok hot before you start the cooking!</p>
