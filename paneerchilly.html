    		<div class="col-sm-6"><p style="font-size: 22px;">Paneer Chilly is one of those delicacies kids and family members crave for from time to time. Be it at a wedding party, school event or a rainy evening, a piping hot bowl of chilli paneer is enough to light up smiles on faces. Paneer Chilli restaurant-style is served with gravy along with rice noodles or fried rice. Fried paneer cubes are tossed in a sweet, spicy and savoury sauce and deep-fried with a flour coating on top. What's interesting is how the paneer is smoked with the spices to bring out its unique flavours. If you want a crunchy texture, you can add chopped cashews and a few roasted nuts to enhance the taste. For those who are vegan or have lactose-intolerance, we recommend using tofu instead of paneer for this dish. You will still yield the same results in terms of flavour and texture.</p></div>

            <li>
                <p>
                    In the meantime, in a mixing bowl add salt, black pepper crushed, whole wheat flour, rice flour, cornflour, and 2 tablespoon water to combine all the ingredients and make a thick batter. Add marinated paneer and mix to evenly coat.

                <p>
                    Soak the dry red chilli in warm water for 15 minutes and drain the water. Blend to make a fine paste. Cook the chilli paste in 1 teaspoon of oil until it turns thick and is cooked through. Set aside.

    			<h1>Health Benefits of Paneer Chilly</h1>
    			<p style="font-size: 22px;">One of the best paneer chilly benefits is that it is chockful of good protein and fats. Paneer has several vitamins and minerals which benefit heart health. It's easy to digest and is loaded with calcium, a nutrient needed for building strong and healthy bones. For those who face hunger after a workout, a bowl of chilli paneer makes for a filling meal. High-protein meals are always satiating and if you're on ketogenic or high-protein diets, they will help out with your fitness goals. If you're using soy sauce for the dressing, you will be getting the added benefits of fermented foods.  It's good for your immune system and regulates blood pressure. For those who have gluten-allergy, we suggest replacing the atta with coconut flour or gluten-free flour.  Our paneer chilli calories clock at 404kcal per serving which means it's a fantastic fit for any diet plan. If you're trying to lose weight, you cannot skip out on this recipe. </p>

            <div class="col-sm-6"><p style="font-size: 22px;">Paneer Chilli is one of those delicacies kids and family members crave for from time to time. Be it at a wedding party, school event or a rainy evening, a piping hot bowl of chilli paneer is enough to light up smiles on faces. Paneer Chilli restaurant-style is served with gravy along with rice noodles or fried rice. Fried paneer cubes are tossed in a sweet, spicy and savoury sauce and deep-fried with a flour coating on top. What's interesting is how the paneer is smoked with the spices to bring out its unique flavours. If you want a crunchy texture, you can add chopped cashews and a few roasted nuts to enhance the taste. For those who are vegan or have lactose-intolerance, we recommend using tofu instead of paneer for this dish. You will still yield the same results in terms of flavour and texture.</p></div>
